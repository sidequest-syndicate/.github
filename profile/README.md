# Sidequest Syndicate

**A collective of friends exploring passion projects and building things that interest us.**

We're a group of experienced engineers and creators who spend our day jobs shipping software for others. This is where we chase the ideas that keep us up at night.

## What We're About

We love gaming, collectibles, and solving interesting problems with good people.

Sidequest Syndicate is our space to learn new tech, experiment freely, and build things we actually want to use.

## Our Approach

- **Explore the map** - We follow curiosity, not the meta
- **XP over credentials** - We level up by building, not by talking about it
- **Side quests grant XP** - Every project is a chance to level up
- **Small party, big crits** - No bloated raids, no endless buff rotations
